    <h2>τέλος</h2>
    <p>"Pleasure and pain moreover supply the motives of desire and of avoidance, and the springs of conduct generally. This being so, it clearly follows that actions are right and praiseworthy only as being a means to the attainment of a life of pleasure. But that which is not itself a means to anything else, but to which all else is a means, is what the Greeks term the Telos, the highest, ultimate or final Good. It must therefore be admitted that the Chief Good is to live <b>agreeably</b>."</p>
    <p><b>Cicero</b> - On the ends of good and evil
    <p>“I am. I am, I exist, I think, therefore I am; I am because I think, why do I think? I don't want to think any more, I am because I think that I don't want to be, I think that I . . . because . . . ugh!”</p>
    <p><b>Jean-Paul Sartre</b> - Nausea</p>
    <p>"Haven't you noticed that opinion without knowledge is always a poor thing? At the best it is blind—isn't anyone who holds a true opinion without understanding like a blind man on the right road?"</p>
    <p><b>Plato</b> - The Republic</p>
    <p>"How things may be in themselves, without regard to the representations through which they affect us, is utterly beyond the sphere of our cognition."</p>
    <p><b>Immanuel Kant</b> - Critique of Pure Reason</p>
    <p>"I never am really satisfied that I understand anything; because, understand it well as I may, my comprehension can only be an infinitesimal fraction of all I want to understand about the many connections and relations which occur to me, how the matter in question was first thought of or arrived at, etc., etc."</p>
    <p><b>Ada Lovelace</b></p>
    <p>"People almost invariably arrive at their beliefs not on the basis of proof but on the basis of what they find attractive."</p>
    <p><b>Blaise Pascal</b> - The Art of Persuasion</p>
    <p>"The method of science depends on our attempts to describe the world with simple theories: theories that are complex may become untestable, even if they happen to be true. Science may be described as the art of systematic over-simplification-the art of discerning what we may with advantage omit."</p>
    <p><b>Karl Popper</b></p>
    <p>"Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living."</p>

    <p>"The art of not reading is a very important one. It consists in not taking an interest in whatever may be engaging the attention of the general public at any particular time. When some political or ecclesiastical pamphlet, or novel, or poem is making a great commotion, you should remember that he who writes for fools always finds a large public. A precondition for reading good books is not reading bad ones: for life is short."</p>

    <p>"Everything that burns, everything that rips me apart, I want to suffer with my body. I'd rather have a hundred wounds, whips, poisons - than this kind of suffering in the head, this phantom of suffering, which touches me softly and caresses me without ever really hurting."</p>
