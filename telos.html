    <h2>τέλος</h2>
    <p>"Pleasure and pain moreover supply the motives of desire and of avoidance, and the springs of conduct generally. This being so, it clearly follows that actions are right and praiseworthy only as being a means to the attainment of a life of pleasure.

It must therefore be admitted that the Chief Good is to live <b>agreeably</b>."</p>
